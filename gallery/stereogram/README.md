# [AI vector Forge](../../README.md) / [Gallery](../../gallery/README.md) / Magic Eye Stereogram

This workshop is for a simple "Magic Eye" style stereogram. It is based on the "hidden-depth stereogram" seed idea.

## Preview

## Description

This SVG is a remixable seed for creating single-image stereograms. This example uses a pattern of repeating dots with slight horizontal shifts to create the illusion of a simple 3D shape when viewed correctly.
