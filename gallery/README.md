This namespace is a collection of workshops for creating and remixing demo seeds, examples, and artistic SVGs. The goal of this namespace is to provide a starting point for creative exploration.

Each subdirectory in this namespace is a self-contained "workshop" for a single SVG. See the main [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on the workshop structure.
