# Gallery Namespace

The `gallery` namespace is a collection of workshops for creating and remixing demo seeds, examples, and artistic SVGs.

## Purpose

The goal of this namespace is to provide a starting point for creative exploration. The SVGs in this namespace are intended to be remixed and built upon.

## Getting Started

To contribute a new piece to the gallery, please see the main [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) file for instructions on how to set up a new workshop. You can browse the existing gallery workshops in the [`/gallery`](../../gallery) directory.
