# Logos Namespace

The `logos` namespace is a collection of workshops for creating and iterating on logos.

## Purpose

This namespace serves as a dedicated area for developing logos for various projects, brands, and ideas. Each logo has its own "workshop" directory where it can be developed and refined.

## Getting Started

To contribute a new logo, please see the main [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) file for instructions on how to set up a new workshop. You can browse the existing logo workshops in the [`/logos`](../../logos) directory.
